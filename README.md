# Ghost-Hunt-Tracker-C
Built a prototype ghost-hunting game in C with modular back-end systems simulating hunter–ghost interactions. Designed custom subclasses and dynamic memory management for stable performance. Achieved zero memory leaks with efficient cleanup, ensuring realistic, responsive gameplay.

## Features

- Realistic hunter–ghost interaction simulation

- Modular subsystem design with reusable components

- Data parsing, classification, and comparison via custom subclasses

- Dynamic memory allocation with zero leaks


## Tech Stack

- Language: C
